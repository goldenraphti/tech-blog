description: What's the best free font for coding. Operator Mono alternative.
---

Who doesn't want to have a perfect setup when you know you're gonna spend hours on it every single day? As everyone I had heard about the amazing [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles). Buuuut, it's super pricey üí∏. And even though I know crafting beautiful fonts have a cost, I'm not ready to pay that much for a font. So I went on a quest to find the best free alternative.

And here it is ... ü•Å ...

My pick ...

Victor Mono! üéâ [Go give it a look](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/)

I've used it for years and am not looking back.

And a few hours ago I discovered GitHub's new monospace fonts [Monaspace](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/), and it looks super interesting and promising. The mix&match to have a combination of mono + cursive, which makes Operator Mono & Victor mono shine, is lacking at the moment though. There are [GitHub issues](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/issues/30) opened about it. And as soon as this is fixed or that I manage to fix my VSCode setup to workaround, I'm gonna give it a try for a few days and see if I stick with it.
