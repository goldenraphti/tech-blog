# {{title}}

I've been meaning to help in some ways the OSS (Open Source Software) projects I love. Among those is Firefox.

Today Firefox DevTools thanks me on their Twitter profile: [https://twitter.com/FirefoxDevTools/status/1527661306735693827](https://twitter.com/FirefoxDevTools/status/1527661306735693827)

It started a few years back, when my colleague Dusan wanted to use this "class preview on autocomplete scrolling" feature he saw in Google Chrome. It sinked in. And me using more and more TailwindCSS (or other utility classes) and loving prototyping in the browser, I started to find myself switching to Chrome just for this. Until one day where I thought: "if it's not in then could I maybe add it [myself](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1654731) ?" ...
almost 6 months later, an[ incredible help](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D132261) from jdescotte from the Firefox DevTools team, and ta-daaa !!!

I think this is one of my proudest moment of my FE dev career so far ðŸ¤©
