What a moment. The Guardian, the world-reknown newspaper, has published our poject ["Map The World"](https://maptheworld.no/).
The site, done with [Oslo World](https://www.osloworld.no), the amazing music festival taking place each November in Oslo Norway, meant to gives each us locked in our homes a way to travel & escape through music around the world. And a way for 150 festivals from each continent to showcase their artists and their -canceled- lineups.

> In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that music has a positive effect. It can enhance the sense of togetherness, it can calm us in times of fear and anxiety and it can remind us that there are better times to come.

> The map is meant as a reminder of the way festivals represent different views and music philosophies, in addition to being places where people meet to have a good time. All over the world, festivals represent cultural gravity points, each and every one contributing to a vibrant and pluralistic global music scene. An entire ecosystem is threatened, our festival family, our venues as well as our collaborators and artists.
